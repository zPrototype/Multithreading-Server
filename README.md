# Multithreading-Server for educational purpose only!

A simple multithreading server to handle several client connections.
Please note that I´m nowhere near being a ’pro’ programmer I´m just learning myself and want to share my scripts with you
so if you find any errors or have an idea to help me make the script better feel free to contact me!

Kind regards,
zPrototype
